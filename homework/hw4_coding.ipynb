    "**Due by midnight on Friday February 14, 2020. Submit on Canvas**. Answer all of the following problems. These problems should be completed in this notebook (using the R kernel). Computational questions may require code, plots, analysis, interpretation, etc. Working in small groups is allowed, but it is important that you make an effort to master the material and hand in your own work. \n",
